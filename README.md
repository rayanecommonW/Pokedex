Sup, this is my take on a pokedex app. I'm using React and nestJS (Typescript ofc) and PokeAPI found at https://pokeapi.co.

This document will guide you through setting up and running both the backend and frontend components of this application.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you install nodejs duh

## Backend Setup

Follow these steps to get the backend up and running:

1.  **Go to /backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
    Boom ez

## Frontend Setup

Here's how to get the frontend running:

1.  **Go to /frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend with vite:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Accessing the Application

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running go to `http://localhost:5173` and boom it works
